After COVID 19 pandemic the world will not be the same. People now understand the importance of social distancing and how technologies may help. Our team proposes a smart shop system where customers do not need to worry about queues, interactions with cashiers, assistants. We would like to create a shop with IoT system where Artificial Intelligence controls all interactions between customers and products excluding almost all health risks. The implementation includes cameras, sensors, smart carts and assistants.
